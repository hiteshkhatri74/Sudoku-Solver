A JavaScript Sudoku Solver first accepts an input size, ensuring itâ€™s at least 4 and a perfect square.Once validated, it creates a dynamic table for users to input Sudoku puzzle values. The solver then processes these
inputs and uses algorithms, like backtracking, to provide a completed solution. This project showcases efficient grid handling, user input validation, and problem-solving techniques in JavaScript
